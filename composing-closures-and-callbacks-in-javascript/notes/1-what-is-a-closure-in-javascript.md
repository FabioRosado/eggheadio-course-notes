# Lesson 1 - What is a Closure in Javascript

*[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-what-is-a-closure-in-javascript)

- A closure is just a function that accesses things outside of it
    - It can capture anything outside of it and use that value each time the function is called

*questions:*
- shouldn't `i` increase to 1 when logging `i++`?

This is like a for loop, it wipes down the variable asignment
