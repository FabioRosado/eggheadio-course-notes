## About 🔍

🚧 SUSPENSE IS EXPERIMENTAL

One of the biggest challenges to writing software for the web is dealing with asynchrony, but we have to deal with it all the time.

This leads to a bunch of boilerplate code for handling loading and error states just to get the data we need to show the user-- whether the data comes from a remote endpoint or from browser APIs like geolocation and Bluetooth.

The end result is countless spinners and the dreaded FOLC (flash of loading content).

React Suspense is the answer to these problems.

React Suspense is a primitive built-into React that drastically simplifies asynchronous state management in our applications, and helps you avoid FOLC out of the box.

It's a bit of a different approach to managing these problems and understanding how it works is key to taking advantage of what it has to offer.

In this workshop, you'll learn how Suspense works under the hood, preparing you for the future of asynchronous state management.
