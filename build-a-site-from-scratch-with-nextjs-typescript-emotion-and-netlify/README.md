## About üîé

This repo contains notes on [Tomasz ≈Åakomy](https://twitter.com/tlakomy)'s collection [Build a site from scratch with Next.js, TypeScript, Emotion and Netlify](https://egghead.io/playlists/build-a-blog-with-next-js-typescript-emotion-and-netlify-adcc). These notes follow along with the collection and guide you as you create a blog in TypeScript that pulls in content from an API, generates dynamic pages, sets up styling with emotion styled components, and deploys to Netlify.

In addition to helpful code snippets, keep an eye out for these friendly Emojis throughout these notes:

- üìú : A helpful link to the documentation
- üìù : An important note that something might have changed since the lesson was made
- üß© : A useful piece of information
- üí° : An idea for a future feature
